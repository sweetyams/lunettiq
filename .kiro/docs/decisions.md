### ADR-011: Canonical Frame-Level Inventory

**Date:** 2026-04-23 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Lunettiq sells the same physical frame as both optical and sun configurations. Shopify has separate variants, Square has separate catalog items. Tracking inventory at variant level causes double-counting and false stockouts.

**Decision:** Inventory tracks at `family + colour + location` level — the physical frame. `inventory_levels` table uses `familyId + colour + locationId` as the canonical key. All Shopify variants and Square items for the same frame project from the same stock pool. Non-family products fall back to variant-level tracking. Lunettiq Postgres is the inventory master; Shopify and Square are projections updated via `projectToChannels()`.

**Consequences:** Selling any variant (optical or sun) decrements the same pool. All channel projections update on every change. Requires family membership to be accurate. Products not in families track independently at variant level.

### ADR-010: Extended Choice Types — Product, Content, Lens Colour

**Date:** 2026-04-22 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The configurator needs add-on products, content displays, and lens colour pickers. Initially modelled as group types, but this prevented mixing types within a group and conflated display with data concerns.

**Decision:** Refactored to **choice types** on `cfg_choices`: `standard`, `product`, `colour`, `content`. Each choice defines its own behaviour — a single group can mix all types. Colour choices link to shared `lens_colour_sets` via `lensColourSetId`. Product choices link to Shopify via `shopifyProductId`. Prices: standard from `cfg_price_rules`, colour from `lens_colour_options.price`, product from Shopify. `groupType` removed from `step_choice_groups`.

**Consequences:** More flexible — "Lens Finish" group can have standard "Clear" + colour "Custom Tint" + content "What's included" together. Colour palettes managed centrally in Settings → Lens Colours. Flow builder has CMS-style inline add bar with 4 type options. Preview renders per-choice-type with swatch expander for colours.

### ADR-009: Remove Legacy Product Options UI, Rename Channels → Flows

**Date:** 2026-04-22 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The product-options page had two views: "Builder" (flow editor + live preview) and "Logic & Diagnostics" (raw CRUD tables for legacy option_groups/options/price_rules/constraint_rules/step_definitions). The diagnostics view used a separate API (`/api/crm/product-options`) and two dead components (ConstraintMatrix, ExclusionGroups). "Channels" was confusing — implies sales channels, not configurator flows.

**Decision:** Removed the Logic & Diagnostics view, its API route, and dead components (~350 lines). Renamed all UI labels from "Channels" to "Flows" to match the data model (`configurator_flows`). URL path `/channels` kept for bookmark stability.

**Consequences:** Single-view product-options page (Builder only). Legacy tables still exist and are seeded, but no longer have a direct CRM editing UI — managed through the flow builder instead. "Flows" terminology is consistent with the DB schema.

### ADR-008: Cubitts Channel — Data-Only Seed into Existing Configurator

**Date:** 2026-04-22 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need a Cubitts-branded configurator flow (frame colour → frame size → lens type → lens colour → lens coatings → summary) with GBP pricing (£175 base, +£50 polarisation). The existing configurator has two parallel table systems: legacy (option_groups/options/price_rules/constraint_rules/step_definitions) and builder (configuratorFlows/flowSteps/stepChoiceGroups/cfgChoices/groupChoices/cfgPriceRules).

**Decision:** Add `cubitts` to the `channel` enum and seed data into both table systems via `scripts/seed-cubitts-channel.ts`. No schema changes — Cubitts-specific option groups and options are scoped via the `channels` jsonb array on each option. Frame colour maps to `finish_state` layer, frame size to `material` layer, lens colour/coatings to existing layers. Builder tables use `currency: 'GBP'` on price rules.

**Consequences:** Cubitts channel is fully isolated from optical/sun/reglaze via channel scoping. Existing configurator UI/engine works unchanged — just reads different data for the cubitts channel. GBP pricing introduces multi-currency in the builder price rules (existing channels use CAD).

### ADR-007: Implicit Exclusion via Group Selection Mode

**Date:** 2026-04-21 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Current constraint_rules table has 23 rows, most encoding mutual exclusions that are already implied by single-select groups. Manual pairwise rules are hard to maintain and error-prone. Matrix UI helps visualize but doesn't fix the root cause.

**Decision:** Selection mode on groups (`single`, `multi`) implies default behavior. Single-select = siblings mutually exclusive automatically. Rules table only stores exceptions and cross-group logic (`requires`, `excludes`, `allowed_if`, `hidden_if`, `price_modifier_if`). Admin UI organized as: flow editor (channel → steps → groups) + option catalogue + targeted rule builder. Matrix becomes read-only QA view.

**Consequences:** Most existing constraint_rules rows become unnecessary — replaced by group selection mode. Rule count drops from ~23 to ~5-8 cross-group exceptions. Configurator engine must check group selection mode before evaluating rules. Admin UI needs full rebuild around flow-first editing.

### ADR-006: No Shopify Plus — Draft Order Checkout

**Date:** 2026-04-21 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Shopify Plus $2,300/mo. Lunettiq configured eyewear (frame + lens + coatings + Rx) needs custom pricing Shopify standard cart can't compute.

**Decision:** Stay standard Shopify. Custom cart client-side → `POST /api/checkout/create` → Draft Order via Admin API → redirect to Shopify invoice page.

**Consequences:** No Checkout Extensibility/Functions/Scripts. All pricing in CRM engine. Draft Order = only checkout path for configured eyewear. Storefront API cart still used for simple accessories.

---

### ADR-005: DB-Driven Pricing Engine

**Date:** 2026-04-21 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Lens pricing = base per channel + addon stacking + constraints. Shopify variants can't model (each colour = own product, no lens-feature variants).

**Decision:** Pricing engine reads `option_groups`, `options`, `price_rules`, `constraint_rules` from Postgres. Quotes computed server-side, attached as cart line attributes. Draft order gets final price.

**Consequences:** CRM-managed pricing, no deploys for addon changes. Needs reconciliation between quote and draft order total.

### ADR-004: Dual Currency Loyalty (Credits + Points)

**Date:** 2026-04-21 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Membership credits (monthly accrual, store currency) ≠ engagement points (earned via actions, 100:$5).

**Decision:** Single `credits_ledger` table, `currency` enum (`credit` | `points`). Transaction types prefixed. Separate balance queries.

**Consequences:** One table, two balances. Points expire (18mo), credits don't. One-way conversion (points → credits).

---

### ADR-003: Shopify Projection Tables

**Date:** 2026-04-21 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** CRM needs fast queries + joins to CRM data. Shopify API rate-limited, no complex queries.

**Decision:** Webhook-synced projection tables in Neon. Shopify → Inngest → idempotent upserts. CRM reads local DB only.

**Consequences:** Eventually consistent (seconds). Webhook failures need retry + nightly reconciliation. Schema tracks Shopify shape changes.

---

### ADR-002: Conditional Integration Loading

**Date:** 2026-04-21 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** 15+ integrations, not all enabled. Dead code bloats bundles + leaks API calls.

**Decision:** All integration code gated on `isIntegrationEnabled()` / `getKey()`. Dynamic imports only. Exceptions: Shopify, Neon, Clerk, Next.js.

**Consequences:** Zero bundle cost when disabled. Every touchpoint needs guard. See `steering/architecture.md`.

### ADR-001: Single Next.js Monolith

**Date:** 2026-04-21 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need storefront + CRM + API. Separate deploys = infra complexity for small team.

**Decision:** Single Next.js 14 App Router. Route groups: `(storefront)/`, `crm/` (Clerk-gated), `api/`. Shared `lib/` + `db/`.

**Consequences:** One deploy, one DB, shared types. CRM bundle separate from storefront (route groups). Middleware handles dual auth.
